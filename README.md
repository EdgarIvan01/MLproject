# Decision Tree Model Project for Livestock Production

## Description

This project aims to develop a decision tree model to optimize livestock production. The process begins with data visualization, followed by the application of Machine Learning preprocessing techniques to prepare the data before building the model.

## Project Structure

- **datavisualization**: In this section, we explore different ways to visualize the data, allowing us to better understand the trends and patterns present in the dataset.

- **preprocessing**: Here we apply Machine Learning preprocessing techniques, such as normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables, to prepare the data before training the model.

- **model**: This section contains the development of the decision tree model, including hyperparameter tuning and evaluating the model's performance.

## Objective

The main objective is to build a decision tree model that can help optimize production in livestock farming, providing informed decisions based on data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling
